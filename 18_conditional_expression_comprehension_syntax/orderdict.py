# An OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order that keys were first inserted. 
# The only difference between dict() and OrderedDict() is that:
#
# OrderedDict preserves the order in which the keys are inserted. 
# A regular dict doesnâ€™t track the insertion order, and iterating it gives the 
# values in an arbitrary order. By contrast, the order the items are inserted is 
# remembered by OrderedDict
