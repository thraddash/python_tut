# raise allows you to throw an exception at any time.
# assert enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and throw an exception if it isnâ€™t.
# try clause, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered.
# except is used to catch and handle the exception(s) that are encountered in the try clause.
# else lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause.
# finally enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.
